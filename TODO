# v5.0.0

## Update entry to return `target` instead

Entry has a `time` property that updates constantly. This isn't good for state
updates, as it will always return a new state. It's probably better if I just
return the current `entry.target`. If someone needs more granularity, point them
to the more low-level `useInViewEffect` hook.

## Remove legacy options

`onEnter` and `onLeave` callbacks have been deprecated in favor of the
`useInViewEffect` hook. `target` is an old leftover from the hook's initial
implementation. The current API handles these more gracefully.

## Cache observers

Right now a new IntersectionObserver is created each time the hook is used. It
would be more performant to create a Map where the key is the hashed `options`
object, the value is the respective IntersectionObserver, and attach entries
to that. This is a significant refactor, but worth it in the long run.
